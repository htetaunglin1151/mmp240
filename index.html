    <p>Hi! My name is Htet and I’m a sophomore from BMCC majoring in Multimedia Programming and Design. <br>
        I interned as a social media designer at CUNY Central Office and also run the BMCC Digital Arts Club as a Vice President this Fall 2024.<br>
        Besides, I’m a Notion Campus Ambassador Cohort 2024. This summer, I worked together with a team to help redesign UI/UX of the internal software used by a non-profit organization in Ghana.<br>
        Outside of my work, I like to play table-tennis and go to concerts/ music festivals.<br>
